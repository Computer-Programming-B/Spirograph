Spirograph
=============================================
The [Spriograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) is a toy that was invented in 1965. It creates patterns of shapes by rotating the shapes as they are drawn. In this assignment we will create a simulation of a spirograph pattern by using one or more loops and Turtle graphics. You will use your turtle to draw a shape and then rotate the direction of the turtle. Repeating this process of drawing a shape and then rotating the turtle will create a design similar to what a sprirograph produces. You may find slides 117 - 125 in the [slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rICcmNbnGYsB-cV_6EatPyzcOS2sId80Jh2kayUzm4Q/edit) helpful.   

Your program can use as many different shapes as you like, but you need to use at least one `while` loop to make at least one of the shapes repeat. To make the pattern interesting, you should consider writing a function that makes a particular shape and then experiment the size, color, line thickness and fill. Have fun and be creative, your pattern doesn't have to look like any other. Don't hesitate to ask for help if your aren't sure how something is suppose to work.
